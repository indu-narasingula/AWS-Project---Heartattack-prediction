## Project Scope
### The project focuses on data visualization and machine learning in the field of public health and healthcare. The machine learning component utilizes a dataset from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to identify and avoid heart disease risk factors. This involves developing machine learning algorithms to forecast and control the risks of cardiac disease. Furthermore, the initiative broadens its focus to include data visualization methodologies, with the objective of furnishing clear and perceptive graphical depictions of the dataset. The combined scope provides a thorough method that improves comprehension and decision-making in the prevention of heart disease by leveraging both machine learning and visualization.

## Domain-specific Challenges:
### Analyzing a dataset on heart disease presents a number of domain-specific difficulties in the healthcare industry. Considering the sensitive nature of health information, privacy and data security are critical factors. Maintaining patient confidentiality requires rigorous adherence to laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The handling of personal health data must be done carefully to avoid misuse or unauthorized access due to ethical concerns.Furthermore, biases in the dataset might come out and affect how accurate machine learning models are. The model may display bias, for example, if the dataset disproportionately covers particular demographic groups or geographic areas. This could result in differences in the identification of risk factors. A sophisticated strategy combining in-depth knowledge of healthcare laws and moral principles with sophisticated data analytics is required to address these issues and guarantee the ethical and responsible use of health information for the management and prevention of heart disease.

## KPI’s: 
### The Risk Factor Identification Rate is pivotal, ensuring the accurate pinpointing of factors contributing to heart disease for effective preventive measures. The Preventive Action Adoption Rate gauges the practical impact, measuring the percentage of cases where identified risk factors lead to successful preventive actions or interventions. A low False Positive Rate is essential to minimize unnecessary interventions, reflecting the precision of the model in identifying true cases. Sensitivity for High-Risk Individuals is vital to ensure that the model effectively identifies individuals at the highest risk of heart disease, guiding targeted interventions.The Precision for Preventive Actions assesses the accuracy of the model in recommending particular preventive actions. The overall model accuracy gives an overall assessment of how well the model identifies and prevents heart disease risk factors. A Population-level Impact Score reflects the machine learning model's overall effectiveness in promoting heart disease prevention and management at the population level by taking into account the number of risk factors that have been identified, adoption rates, and overall impact.
